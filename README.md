# Tapsheets
When the digital printer was invented, people were most likely excited to 'transfer their things from the digital world to the real world'. However, it's really hard to see all of the documents you need to print neatly. Not anymore! Meet Tapsheets.
## What is Tapsheets?
Tapsheets is a PHP-based solution to this problem. Tapsheets has a simple, user-friendly and list-based interface and allows you to print any document fast.
## How do I run a Tapsheets server?
1. Download Tapsheets to your web server directory.
2. Open the file and set up Algolia.
3. Add items to the list in your Algolia dashboard. The fields used are `url` (the URL of the printable document), `name` (the name of the printable document), and `description` (a short but optional description).
